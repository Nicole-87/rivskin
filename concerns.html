                  <h1>Rosecea
                <img id="rosecea" src="images/rosecea.jpg" alt="rosecea"></h1>
                <p id="rosecea-text">Rosecea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that usually affects the nose and cheeks. It can vary from broken veins and red skin to inflamed acne, dryness and cause the nose to become bulbous in extreme cases. It is unknown what exactly causes Rosecea, however with most patients they usually have something that can trigger symptoms such as alcohol, spicy foods, extreme conditions hot or cold. There are many treatments and products that will relieve and treat symptoms of rosecea. 
                  IPL is a fantastic treatment for rosecea as it helps to diminish the redness and veins that appear with the condition. This is a broad light treatment which creates a coagulation within the visible veins and over time kills them. 
                  Chemical peels will also help to treat some of the symptoms of rosecea. 
                  Ultimately, it is important that you are using the correct skin products at home and to have regular consultations with your skin therapist when you are nearly out of products to ensure if any changes need to be made.</p>

          <p id="pigmentation-text">These are many forms of pigmentation. The only one that can be treated is hyperpigmentation (usually sun damage). Sometimes pigmentation can be caused by hormonal factors such as contraceptive pill, pregnancy, menopause, etc. Often these types of pigmentation cannot be treated using lasers as the heat from the laser can cause the pigment to worsen, and the safer option is to treat using a course of specialised products, however this may take a little longer to treat. </p>

         <h1>Acne<img  id="acne" src="images/bluePeel.jpg" alt="peel"></h1>
          <p id="acne-text">Many people assume that only teenagers can have acne, but this is a common disorder across all ages, especially now with more financial and work based stressors. 
            Acne is an inflammation of the hair follicle caused by a build up of sebum (oil) and dead skin cells which creates the perfect breeding ground for the P-acne bacteria. Adult acne and teenage acne are very different and should be treated as such. Depending on the severity of acne, there are many treatments and medications that may help with the symptoms. Acne can range from an excess of oil in the skin and white heads to cysts and boils. It is imperative that spots are not popped or picked and left heal by themselves as this can cause bacteria to spread and can also lead to secondary issues such as scarring. 
            Chemical peels are a fantastic treatment for treating active acne. Fraxel can be used to treat acne scarring once the active acne has been treated. </p>
